    <p>I was born in 2010, in India, in the state of kerala. I lived in India till I was seven.
  Then after that, I came to france at the age of seven. I first went to paris and lived there for a year. I was living in rue mouton duvernet in the 14th arondissement of paris.
  When I was there, I was going to delambre school, I was going to UPE2A, because at that time I didn't know to speak French and I learned to speak French in two months.
  After that I came to sceaux and I haven't moved since.</p>

    <p>In India I was in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore target="_blank">Bangalore</a>, there I studied in two different schools. I studied in <a href=https://mountlitera.com/ target="_blank"> Mount litera Zee school</a> and in <a href=https://www.vydehischool.com/ target="_blank">Vydehi school of excellence</a>.
  Then I came to france where I studied in Ecole Delambre, in Clos ST Marcel and then I started studying in marie curie which is the place where I am still studying now.
